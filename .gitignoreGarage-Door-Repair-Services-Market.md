This led to higher demand for professional services.</li>  <li><strong>Homeownership Boom:</strong> The steady rise in homeownership, especially in suburban areas, directly contributed to increased demand for maintenance and repair services.</li>  <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> The integration of smart home features into garage doors, such as remote monitoring and automated systems, created new repair needs and further boosted market growth.</li>  <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> A stable economy during this period allowed more people to invest in their homes, including upgrading or maintaining their garage doors.</li></ul><p>Overall, the 2018-2022 market showed strong, consistent growth, with annual market value growing by an estimated 3.5% year-over-year.</p><h2>2023-2033: Forecasting Future Demand</h2><p>Looking forward to the 2023-2033 period, industry experts expect the garage door repair services market to continue evolving, albeit with notable changes. Several emerging trends are likely to influence the sector:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Smart Garage Door Systems:</strong> As more consumers adopt smart home technology, the demand for repair services related to these advanced systems is expected to soar.
